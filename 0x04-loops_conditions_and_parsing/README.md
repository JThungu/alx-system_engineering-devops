0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing
This repository contains solutions and examples for the topic of Loops, Conditions, and Parsing. The code provided here demonstrates how to implement various loops, handle conditions, and parse data in different programming languages.

Introduction
In computer programming, loops and conditions are fundamental constructs used to control the flow of execution in a program. Loops allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly, while conditions enable us to make decisions based on certain criteria.

Parsing, on the other hand, refers to the process of extracting meaningful information from a given input. It is commonly used when dealing with data in various formats like JSON, XML, CSV, etc.

This repository provides examples and solutions that showcase how to effectively use loops and conditions to solve problems and how to parse data in different programming languages.
