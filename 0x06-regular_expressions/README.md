ALX 0x06 Regular Expression
Description
ALX 0x06 Regular Expression is a project that explores the concept of Regular Expressions in the context of programming and text processing. Regular Expressions, commonly referred to as regex, are powerful patterns used to match and manipulate strings in a flexible and efficient way. This project provides examples and exercises to help developers understand and master the art of crafting regular expressions for various use cases.

Regular Expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that define search patterns. They allow you to perform complex string matching and manipulation operations. In this project, we dive deep into the world of regex and explore how to use them effectively in different programming languages and environments.

Getting Started
To use this project, you need a basic understanding of programming and regular expressions. Familiarity with the programming language of your choice is essential, as we provide examples in multiple languages.

Usage
This project serves as both a learning resource and a reference guide for using regular expressions. You can explore the examples provided in the "examples" directory and modify them to suit your needs. Additionally, the "exercises" directory contains challenges for you to practice and solidify your regex skills.
