## Introduction to SSH

SSH is widely used in the IT industry to securely manage servers, transfer files, and execute commands remotely. This repository aims to provide guidance and examples for both beginners and experienced users to leverage the power of SSH.

## Getting Started

If you are new to SSH, start by reading the [SSH Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)) for a general understanding of the protocol.

To get started with SSH on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. [Install OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) or use the SSH client that comes pre-installed with many Unix-based operating systems.

2. Clone this repository to access code examples and resources.
