Processes and Signals

Overview
This repository contains code and explanations related to the topic of processes and signals in computer programming. In modern operating systems, processes are fundamental units that allow multiple tasks to be executed concurrently. Signals, on the other hand, are used for inter-process communication and process management.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of processes and signals, including their creation, management, and interaction. It includes sample code in various programming languages to illustrate the concepts discussed.

Process Creation
Learn how to create new processes from an existing process using system calls or language-specific libraries. Understand the relationship between the parent and child processes and how to pass data between them.

Process Termination
Discover the various ways processes can terminate, both normally and abnormally. Explore exit codes, zombie processes, orphan processes, and how to handle process termination gracefully.

Inter-Process Communication
Explore different mechanisms for Inter-Process Communication (IPC). Understand how processes can exchange data and synchronize their actions using techniques like pipes, shared memory, and message queues.

Signals
Learn about signals, which are used to notify processes of events and allow them to respond appropriately. This section covers the concept of signals, common signals available in a system, and their default behaviors.

Handling Signals
Understand how to handle signals programmatically. Learn about signal handlers, how to install custom signal handlers, and how to respond to specific signals in your code.

Sample Code
The sample_code directory contains practical examples and code snippets to demonstrate the concepts discussed in previous sections. Each example is placed within a separate directory and accompanied by a README explaining the code's purpose and usage.
