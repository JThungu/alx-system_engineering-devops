## Introduction

In this project, we will explore how to configure and secure your web application using HTTPS SSL, ensuring that your users' data remains confidential and secure during transmission.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) installed and running.
- A domain name (e.g., example.com) registered and pointed to your server's IP address.
- Basic knowledge of using Git and a Git repository set up for your project.

## Setting Up HTTPS SSL

1. **Obtain an SSL Certificate**: You can obtain SSL certificates from a trusted certificate authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt, or you can purchase one from a commercial CA.

2. **Install SSL Certificate**: Follow the CA's instructions to install the SSL certificate on your web server. This usually involves copying the certificate and private key files to the appropriate locations on your server.

3. **Configure Web Server**: Update your web server's configuration (e.g., Apache's `httpd.conf` or Nginx's `nginx.conf`) to enable SSL. Ensure that the SSL certificate and private key paths are correctly specified in the configuration file.

4. **Test SSL Configuration**: Restart your web server and test the SSL configuration to make sure it's working correctly. You can use online tools like [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to check your SSL setup.

5. **Automatic Renewal**: Set up automatic certificate renewal to ensure your SSL certificate remains valid. For Let's Encrypt, you can use Certbot to automate certificate renewal.

## Git Integration

To integrate your project with Git for version control, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Git Repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
